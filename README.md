# Kosmos Docs & Website

This repo contains the source code of [KubeNest website](https://kosmos-io.github.io/kubenest-website/) and all the docs for Kosmos.
It's built by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

- [KubeNest website](https://kosmos-io.github.io/kubenest-website)
- [KubeNest docs](https://kosmos-io.github.io/kubenest-website/getting-started/introduction)

Welcome to join us, and you are more than appreciated to contribute!

## Add or Update Docs

When you add or modify the docs, these two files(`docs/` and `i18n/zh-Hans/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current`) should be taken into consideration.

## Run with Node.js

If you have the Node.js environment, you can run the website locally.

- It is recommended to use version node v18.0.0+ and npm v8.6+
- You can download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.0.0)

```shell
# Clone the repo, or your own fork
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/website.git

# build
yarn

# Start the site
yarn start
```

Once the site is running locally, you can preview the site by visiting [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
